This repository contains code to prototype the possible External Developer API application form.

## The problem
The current External Developer API registration form for VES (https://developer-portal.driver-vehicle-licensing.api.gov.uk/apis/vehicle-enquiry-service/Register-For-VES-API.html) is:
- embarrasing
- causing issues with the team who action items in the dvlaapiaccess@dvla.gov.uk mailbox

Specifically there have been a number (currently an uknown amount) of emails with insufficient information in the requests.
